# tweeting job-market candidates for @jenniferdoleac

Update filepath and twitter API credentials in `tweet.R` and run file. Will need to create a twitter developer app. These are useful instructions for getting started with the twitteR package: (https://www.r-bloggers.com/send-tweets-from-r-a-very-short-walkthrough/). See [`/misc/twitter_app_screenshot.png`](https://github.com/cjwichman/tweet-women-jmc/blob/master/misc/twitter_app_screenshot.png) for example app details.

Data on JMCs can be manually entered in `/data/candidate_list.xlsx`. 

Save abstract screenshots as .png files in `/abstractimages/`. __Important:__ Title each abstract as `<firstname><lastname>.png` in all lowercase letters. First and last names needs to sync with the entries in the candidate_list.xlsx spreadsheet. [We might want to think about storing these .png files somewhere else.]

Example tweets can be seen here: https://twitter.com/cjw29037066

NB: @cjwichman is still learning git/github and is primarily a Stata user [gasp]. Suggestions encouraged.
